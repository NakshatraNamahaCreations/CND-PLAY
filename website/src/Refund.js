        At CND PLAY, we strive to provide you with a satisfying user experience. This Refund, Return, and
        Cancellation Policy explains our guidelines regarding refunds, returns, and cancellations for your
        purchases on our platform. Please read this policy carefully before making any purchase.
      </p>
      <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>a. Content Availability:</strong> Once you have successfully purchased and gained access to a specific content
        item on CND PLAY, such as a movie or TV show, we do not offer refunds based on the availability or
        removal of that content. We encourage you to check the availability and details of the content before
        making a purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>b. Technical Issues:</strong> In the event of technical issues on our platform that prevent you from accessing
        the content you have purchased, please contact our customer support team at
        <a href="mailto:cndplay.help@gmail.com">cndplay.help@gmail.com</a>. We will investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. If we are
        unable to provide a resolution within a reasonable timeframe, we may offer a refund at our discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>c. Multiple Payments for Single Content:</strong> If you unintentionally make multiple payments for the same
        content item due to technical glitches or other reasons, please contact our customer support team
        with the relevant details. We will review the situation and, if verified, issue a refund for the additional
        payment(s).
      </p>
      <h2>Return Policy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>a. Content Delivery:</strong> Since our content is delivered digitally and immediately upon purchase, we
        do not accept returns or provide refunds based on user preferences or change of mind after the
        content has been accessed.
      </p>
      <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>a. Subscription Cancellations:</strong> If you have subscribed to a recurring subscription plan on CND PLAY,
        you can cancel your subscription at any time. The cancellation will be effective at the end of the
        current billing cycle, and you will not be charged for subsequent billing periods. Please note that we
        do not offer refunds for partial billing cycles.
      </p>
      <h2>Validity of Content</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>a. Each subscription plan or Content Plan:</strong> has a specified validity period during which users have
        access to the services and content provided by CND Play. The validity period begins upon
        activation of the subscription and ends upon its expiration, as indicated in the user's account
        settings or purchase confirmation.
